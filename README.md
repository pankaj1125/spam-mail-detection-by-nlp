# Spam Mail Detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop a spam mail detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system classifies emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.

## Features

- Preprocessing of email text data
- Extraction of text features using TF-IDF
- Classification using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluation of model performance
- Deployment of the model for real-time spam detection

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
